This repository demonstrates a common error in Java programming: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds, resulting in the exception. The solution, shown in `BugSolution.java`, adds a check to prevent this error by ensuring the index is within the valid range before accessing the array element.
